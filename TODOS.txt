- update repository README
    - add installation instructions
- dataset download + preprocessing script to get everything ready
- Code organization
    - document everything
    - organize runner
        - load from config, train multiple models
        - save model, parameters, losses
        - use PyVAE, antonio, topic modeling repo as references
        - use pytorchlighting or ignite (possibly)

    - organize evaluation
        - tsne plot, npmi, ... - evaluate and save all results automatically

    - add parameter grid search, early stopping and periodic model checkpoints to training
    - return all components of the loss (hfvae)
    - print topics (top words) and coherence during training
    - fix perplexity calculation - prodlda_simple
