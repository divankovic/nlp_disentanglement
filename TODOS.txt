- update repository README
    - add installation instructions - last
- document everything - last
- dataset download + preprocessing script to get everything ready - also later, ok for now
- add parameter grid search - not neccessary for now

- Code organization
    - organize runner
        - load from config : DONE
        - train multiple models
        - save model, parameters, losses : DONE

    - early stopping  - DONE
    - periodic model checkpoints to training - DONE
    - return all components of the loss (hfvae) - DONE
    - print topics (top words) and coherence during training - little harder for coherence : CONSIDER LATER

    - organize evaluation
        - tsne plot, npmi, ... - evaluate and save all results automatically
        - extract all methods to functions first (some evaluation methods need some fine-tuning)
