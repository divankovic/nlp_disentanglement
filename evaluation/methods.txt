tSNE plot
mutual information I(x,z), I(y,z)
HFVAE - topic coherence score (NPMI)
vector similarity for classes (pico paper)
latent traversal (changing one dimension of z - eth master thesis)
classification accuracy using the latent space as features (non-parallel text style transfer paper)
ablation testing (non-parallel text style transfer paper) - removing parts of the loss, inspecting changes
